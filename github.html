<h1>Hey, GitHub!</h1>
<p>Thank you for checking out my portfolio site.</p>
<p>I know what you're looking for in your next Web Designer, so here's my most relevant web design, front-end development, branding, style guide, and illustration work.</p>

<h2>About This Site</h2>
<p>This site was hand-crafted just to demonstrate my favorite GitHub-flavored technologies. It was lovingly built using Atom, the GitHub repo is live on my personal account, and I'm hosting this Jekyll-powered static site on GitHub pages. In the code, I use SASS and a custom Gulp.JS setup that I modified from ShakyShane's popular repo so I could use Pug.JS for my favorite HTML preprocessor.</p>
