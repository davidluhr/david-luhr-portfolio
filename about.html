  <blockquote>It’s possible to drive serious business results without killing the fun.</blockquote>
  <p>I love creating delightful and engaging websites that add value for users and facilitate better business. I enjoy taking on complex problems, improving processes, and measuring impact, all without being a grump about it.</p>
  <p>As someone with way too many interests and hobbies, I’ve had an unconventional trajectory in the worlds of design and development.</p>
  <p>I’ve gone from contemporary art museums, doing exhibition design and fabrication, to for-profit ecommerce, implementing A/B testing, conversion rate optimization, responsive HTML email marketing, and web design to drive sales, to higher education, pushing traditional boundaries with crafted, audience-specific experiences.</p>
  <p>I’m currently the Senior Web Designer at Westminster College, in Salt Lake City, Utah. I oversee Westminster’s user experience, visual design, front-end development, and a slew of other responsibilities. I’m passionate about innovating Westminster’s online presence and breaking higher education convention to speak more genuinely to students about the school’s experience and values.</p>

  <p>Outside of my professional work, I’m constantly creating, exploring, and learning. On any given weekend, I may spend my time riding my BMX bike at the local skateparks, whittling a spoon at my traditional woodworking bench, or hiking through the trees in the local mountains. I try to travel as frequently as possible, and fell in love with Japan as my favorite destination. When I catch a spare moment, I obsessively read sci-fi and personal finance books, or I devour e-courses, webinars, and Medium articles that expand my technology stack and design thinking.</p>
  <p>All in all, I am addicted to the steep learning curves of taking on something new, and there are simply too many fascinating, fun, and challenging new ventures to ever settle for being a specialist.</p>

  <h2>About This Site</h2>
  <p>This site was hand-crafted using Atom, <a href="https://github.com/davidluhr/david-luhr-portfolio" target="_blank">the GitHub repo is live on my personal account</a>, and I'm hosting this Jekyll-powered static site on GitHub pages.</p>
  <p>The design process followed my normal progression from rapid sketch iterations to digital mockups before diving into code.</p>

  <p>For this project, I used the beta release Adobe Xd for the digital mockups and early prototyping. I've fallen in love with this workflow and look forward to using it much more.</p>

  <p>In the code, I use SASS and a custom Gulp.JS setup that I modified from <a href="https://github.com/shakyShane/jekyll-gulp-sass-browser-sync" target="_blank">ShakyShane's popular repo</a> so I could use my favorite development tools.</p>
