<h2 class="t-section-heading detail__section-heading">Overview</h2>
<p class="t-body detail__body">Build UX is a YouTube channel that features video series on HTML, CSS, accessibility, and designer-developer collaboration. Each video series covers a robust product design and UX development process, from static mockups to polished user experiences.</p>

<h2 class="t-section-heading detail__section-heading">Problem</h2>
<p class="t-body detail__body">As a self-taught designer and developer, I relied on online learning resources as the foundation of my early career. Coding courses, YouTube videos, and podcasts provided immense value in forming my product design and development knowledge.</p>
<p class="t-body detail__body">As my career progressed, and my level of expertise grew, I began seeing a huge void in free educational resources that covered realistic projects with in-depth best practices. Particularly, I struggled to find material that properly covered workflows related to design systems, accessibility, pixel-perfect development, or performance. However, I kept seeing designers and developers asking for this level of learning, and I also saw teams and products from the majority of companies with shortcomings in these same areas.</p>

<h2 class="t-section-heading detail__section-heading">Solution</h2>
<p class="t-body detail__body">Build UX is my answer to this need. As an ad-free YouTube channel, I want to provide complete access to professional knowledge and best practices. My hope is to achieve a wide reach with infomation that will improve the process and quality of work within product teams, thereby making websites and web applications more performant, delightful, and accessible for all users.</p>

<h3 class="t-sub-heading detail__sub-heading">UI video series</h3>
<p class="t-body detail__body">Each Build UX video series covers the full process of refining UI designs with a design system and accessibility focus. Then, these designs are prepared for effective designer-developer collaboration with detailed, holistic documentation. Next, development begins with clean, semantic markup, followed by scalable and pixel-perfect styling. Lastly, each video series ends with code review improvements and testing for performance and accessibility.</p>

<h3 class="t-sub-heading detail__sub-heading">In-depth how-tos</h3>
<p class="t-body detail__body">In addition to the UI video series, Build UX also offers how-to videos that dive deep into specific techniques and approaches for both product design and UX development. Examples of how-to video topics include advanced component structure in Figma, optimizing and implementing SVGs, and using CSS Grid and Custom Properties at the component level.</p>

<h2 class="t-section-heading detail__section-heading">What&rsquo;s next</h2>
<p class="t-body detail__body">I&rsquo;m continuing to grow Build UX with frequent new video series and how-tos. My vision for Build UX is to always keep the core content both purchase-free and ad-free to reduce any barriers to access. There is no shortage of HTML, CSS, accessibility, design system, and product design topics to cover, so I&rsquo;m looking forward to many, many video to come!</p>
